# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customer retention is a top priority for telecom companies due to the high cost of acquiring new customers. The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and service patterns to identify what drives churn (the voluntary departure of customers) and to build a predictive model that can help the business act proactively.
