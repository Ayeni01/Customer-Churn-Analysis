-- 5. Churn Rate by Category
-- Churn rate by gender
SELECT gender, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
       COUNT(*) AS total,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS churn_rate
FROM customers
GROUP BY gender;

-- Churn by contract type
SELECT Contract, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS churn_rate
FROM customers
GROUP BY Contract;

-- Churn by tenure bucket
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN tenure BETWEEN 0 AND 12 THEN '0-1 Year'
    WHEN tenure BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN '1-2 Years'

-- 7. Filtering Specific Groups
-- Customers with tenure > 12 months and churned
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE tenure > 12 AND Churn = 'Yes';

-- Senior citizens with fiber optic internet who churned
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE SeniorCitizen = 1 AND InternetService = 'Fiber optic' AND Churn = 'Yes';

-- High spenders who did not churn
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE MonthlyCharges > 90 AND Churn = 'No';

-- TASK: Identify Churned Customers Using SQL
-- Objective: Use SQL to isolate churned customers, uncover churn patterns, and prepare key segments for deeper analysis.

-- Step-by-Step Breakdown
-- 1. Isolate Churned Customers
-- Start by pulling all customers who have churned:
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes';

-- 2. Analyze Churned Customer Count
SELECT COUNT(*) AS churned_customers
FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes';

-- 3. Churn by Demographics
-- a. Gender
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS churned_count
FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes'
GROUP BY gender;

-- b. Senior Citizens
SELECT SeniorCitizen, COUNT(*) AS churned_count
FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes'
GROUP BY SeniorCitizen;

-- c. Dependents & Partners
SELECT Partner, Dependents, COUNT(*) AS churned_count
FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes'
GROUP BY Partner, Dependents;

-- 4. Churn by Service Type
-- a. Internet Service
SELECT InternetService, COUNT(*) AS churned_count
FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes'
GROUP BY InternetService;

-- b. Streaming Services
SELECT StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, COUNT(*) AS churned_count
FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes'
GROUP BY StreamingTV, StreamingMovies;

-- c. Tech Support and Security Services
SELECT OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, COUNT(*) AS churned_count
FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes'
GROUP BY OnlineSecurity, TechSupport;

-- 5. Churn by Contract Type & Payment
SELECT Contract, PaymentMethod, COUNT(*) AS churned_count
FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes'
GROUP BY Contract, PaymentMethod;

-- 6. High-Risk Segments: Combined Conditions
-- a. Short Tenure & Month-to-Month
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes' AND tenure <= 12 AND Contract = 'Month-to-month';

-- b. Senior Citizens with Fiber Optic
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes' AND SeniorCitizen = 1 AND InternetService = 'Fiber optic';

-- c. Customers with No Security or Support
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes' AND OnlineSecurity = 'No' AND TechSupport = 'No';

-- 7. Create a View (Optional)
-- For easier future access:

CREATE VIEW churned_customers AS
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE Churn = 'Yes';
